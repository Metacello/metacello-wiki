You can run through lessons of the tutorial on-line by selecting a lesson from the side bar on the left or just start with [Lesson01 Lesson 1]. I recommend that you run through the tutorial in an image at least once, and use the online tutorial as a reference.

To run the Tutorial, first [DownloadMetacello load] Metacello into your image.

Then open two browsers on the MetacelloTutorialConfig class. In the lefthand browser view the methods in the 'lessons' category. In the righthand browser view the '--all--' category. Read the comments in lesson01 through lesson13, then read lesson07 through lesson14 in the MetacelloProjectRefTutorialConfig class for a tutorial covering project references.

After taking the tutorial, visit [APIReference API reference page] for an overview of the full configuration API.

To create your own Metacello configuration, copy the class MetacelloConfigTemplate to your own configuration class, add your own #baseline: and #version: methods and you are off to the races.
