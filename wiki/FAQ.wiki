==Load Latest For Nested Projects==
_For *ConfigurationOfSqueakDBX*, I have defined a baseline with a list of packages and with the following expression, the latest versions of each package will be loaded:_

{{{
(ConfigurationOfSqueakDBX project version: '1.1-baseline') load.
}}}

_Suppose now I have *ConfigurationOfGlorpDBX* which has a project reference to *ConfigurationOfSqueakDBX*. Is there a way to load the latests version of a project
and it dependencies ?_

In order to 'force' a load latest for a referenced (nested) project, set the versionString to the baseline version of the project. For the *ConfigurationOfGlorpDBX* project edit the SqueakDBX project entry with the #versionString: set to '1.1-baseline':

{{{
spec project: 'SqueakDBX' with: [
   spec
     className: 'ConfigurationOfSqueakDBX';
     versionString: '1.1-baseline';
     file: 'ConfigurationOfSqueakDBX';
     repository: 'http://www.squeaksource.com/MetacelloRepository' ].
}}}

Executing the following expression will load the latest code in the ConfigurationOfGlorpDBX and the ConfigurationOfSqueakDBX projects:

{{{
(ConfigurationOfGlorpDBX project version: '0.9-baseline') load.
}}}


----
==Controlling Package Initialization Order==
_Does package initialization in Metacello follow the *#requires:* graph? I have *Chalten-Gregorian* package that *#requires:* the package *Chalten-Core*, but *GregorianDate* class>>initialize is sent before *ChaltenDate* class>>initialize._

In order to control package initialization order, you must use the #linear loadType for your project. The default loadType is #atomic. 

To control the loadType for a project, edit your #project method to look like the following:

{{{
  ^ project ifNil: [ | constructor |
      "Bootstrap Metacello if it is not already loaded"
      self class ensureMetacello.
      "Construct Metacello project"
      constructor := (Smalltalk at: #MetacelloVersionConstructor) on: self.
      project := constructor project.
      project loadType: #linear. "change to #atomic if desired"
      project ]
}}}

==How do I create a Metacello Configuration?==
Go the the class *MetacelloConfigTemplate* and do a 'copy...' of the class to your own *[http://code.google.com/p/metacello/wiki/ConfigurationOfxxx ConfigurationOf<your project name>]* class. Then change the category of the new class to be *ConfigurationOf<your project name>*.
----
==Why can't I just subclass a class to start my Metacello Configuration?==
The short answer is that there is a bootstrapping problem. Metacello is not preloaded in Squeak or Pharo. See [http://groups.google.com/group/metacello/browse_thread/thread/c056f4e44e4523f0/ this thread] for a discussion of the issue.
----
==How do I load the last version of a project?==
The easiest way to do it is to reference to the baseline directly:
{{{
(ConfigurationOfCAnalyzer project version: '1.0-baseline') load
}}}
The code above will bring all the latests version as you are not specifying them.
