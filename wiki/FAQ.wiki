==Load Latest For Nested Projects==
In order to 'force' a load latest for a referenced (nested) project, try
setting the versionString in the baseline spec for the project to the
baseline version (when it is loaded it will load the latest versions
of the packages) ... don't forget to use the proper version in your
version spec.
