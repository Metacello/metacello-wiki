For version 0.3, we've updated the package version to 'Example-Core-anon.10' and added an additional package 'Example-Tests-anon.3', which can be confirmed by printing the following expression:

  `(MetacelloTutorialConfig project version: '0.3') spec.`

As is often the case, the two packages share the same repository, so specifying a repository witheach package is redundant.
